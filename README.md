# Telecom_Churn_Analysis
This project focuses on identifying key factors contributing to customer churn and providing actionable insights to reduce churn rates. The analysis follows a structured data pipeline‚Äîfrom data collection to model deployment‚Äîensuring a comprehensive approach to solving the business problem

## Project Overview üîé
Customer churn is one of the most critical challenges businesses face, directly impacting revenue, customer lifetime value (CLV), and operational costs. This project presents a data-driven end-to-end churn analysis, utilizing SQL, Python, machine learning, and Power BI to uncover churn patterns, predict customer attrition, and develop actionable retention strategies.

This project follows the complete data analytics lifecycle, including data extraction, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, machine learning modeling, business insights generation, and dashboard visualization.

## Business Problem üë®‚Äçüíº

Customer retention is often more cost-effective than acquiring new customers. However, without clear insights into why customers leave, businesses struggle to implement effective retention strategies. This project aims to:

‚úÖ Identify key churn indicators using data-driven methods

‚úÖ Build predictive models to estimate churn likelihood

‚úÖ Provide actionable recommendations to reduce churn

‚úÖ Develop a dashboard for real-time churn monitoring

## Tools and Technologies Used üõ†Ô∏è

This project integrates multiple data analytics and machine learning tools to ensure a robust, scalable solution:

1. SQL ‚Äì Data extraction, transformation, and preparation
2. Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn) ‚Äì Data preprocessing, Exploratory Data Analysis, and machine learning
3. Power BI ‚Äì Interactive dashboard for churn insights and KPI tracking
4. Machine Learning Model i.e.Random Forest

## Step-by-Step Process
1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Collection & Preparation (Tools Used: Microsoft SQL Server, Excel, Python)

1. Extracted raw customer data from a database using SQL
2. Cleaned and transformed data to handle missing/null values, duplicates, and inconsistencies
3. Performed feature selection and engineered new attributes to improve model performance

2Ô∏è‚É£ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)(Tools Used: Python, PowerBI)

- Conducted statistical analysis to understand customer behavior
- Visualized key patterns using visually appealing plots: bar charts
- Identified relationships between customer demographics, usage patterns, and churn likelihood

3Ô∏è‚É£ Feature Engineering & Data Processing

- Created new features such as customer tenure, average transaction frequency, and service usage trends
- Applied encoding techniques for categorical data
- Scaled numerical features to improve model performance

4Ô∏è‚É£ Predictive Modeling

- Built and evaluated a machine learning model to predict customer churn probability
- Compared model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC
- Selected the best-performing model and fine-tuned hyperparameters for improved results

5Ô∏è‚É£ Insights & Business Recommendations

- Identified the top churn drivers such as poor service quality, high pricing, and low engagement
- Recommended targeted interventions such as:
- Personalized offers for high-risk customers
- Improved customer support for specific segments
- Loyalty programs to increase retention rates

- Developed an interactive Power BI dashboard to monitor churn trends in real time
- Designed user-friendly KPIs, charts, and drill-down filters for business stakeholders
- Enabled proactive decision-making based on predictive analytics

## Key Insights & Business Impact

- Main reasons for churning included better competitor pricing and attitude from customer care.
- The above 50 age group presented the highest churning age group.
- Subscription plans with high pricing showed higher churn rates
- Phone and Internet Services showed the hghest churn rate by service.
- Retention efforts based on predictive analytics could reduce churn by 15-25%
